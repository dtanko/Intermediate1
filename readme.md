**Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages**
_~~dynamically-typed languages~~ perform type checking at runtime, while ~~statically typed languages~~ perform type checking at compile time.
_~~Statically-typed languages~~ require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while ~~dynamically-typed languages~~ do not._
_Additionally, unlike statically-typed languages, dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save time and space when writing script_

**Examples of dynamically-typed languages**
_Common examples of dynamically-typed languages includes JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Tcl._
**Examples of statically-typed languages**

**Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined**
_Null is an assigned value, that's it is intentional absence of value_
_Undefined: undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet. In another words, it means the value does not exist in the compiler_
